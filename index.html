        I spend a lot of time on YouTube. When I need to know a fact about a country, I go to YouTube. When I need to learn         how to make royal frosting that hardens when it dries, I go to YouTube. Calculus? <em>YouTube</em>. Watching video           tutorials is a visual learners best friend. But, YouTube is not just used for research. Now there are TV shows,             makeup tutorials, fitness videos, music videos, and the list continues. When I began to think about my overall               digital practices, the first thing I thought of was the time I spend on YouTube. I wanted to know how much time I           spent watching videos, and what exactly I was watching.

 	      I created a scalar vector graph of my research on my personal YouTube usage. I found that I watched more than an             <b>hour</b> of video content a day, some days going well over 100 minutes. I began to wonder about concepts like              loyalty to a creator I was subscribed to and how I affected them by watching their videos.

   	 			<p>
   	 			I began to focus more on how often I would watch a video of a creator I was subscribed to versus a random video. I          found that 92% of the time I was watching a subscribed video. This fact shocked me. I then started researching why          similar videos and creators would show up on my “What to Watch” page. This led me to studying how YouTube uses              psychographics and monetization of videos.

   	 			<p>
   	 			I tried to describe how YouTube using psychographics to target viewers to watch a certain video eventually only             makes about a 14th of a penny for the creator. Now don’t be fooled, this small amount can add up to millions for             some popular content makers. Overall I learned that <em>YouTube Bots</em> track everything you type and watch and           they store that information. I learned that you are always being targeted to watch a video by these bots. I think           all users should know this information.
